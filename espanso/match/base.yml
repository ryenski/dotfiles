# espanso match file

# For a complete introduction, visit the official docs at: https://espanso.org/docs/

# You can use this file to define the base matches (aka snippets)
# that will be available in every application when using espanso.

# Matches are substitution rules: when you type the "trigger" string
# it gets replaced by the "replace" string.
matches:
  # Simple text replacement
  - trigger: ":espanso"
    replace: "Hi there!"

  # NOTE: espanso uses YAML to define matches, so pay attention to the indentation!

  # But matches can also be dynamic:

  # Print the current date
  - trigger: ":date"
    replace: "{{mydate}}"
    vars:
      - name: mydate
        type: date
        params:
          format: "%Y-%m-%d"

  - trigger: ":edb"
    replace: "{{datestamp}}"
    vars:
      - name: datestamp
        type: date
        params:
          format: "%Y-%m-%d Engineering Daybook"
  - trigger: ":cc"
    label: "Test Credit Card"
    replace: '4111111111111111'
  - trigger: ":dcc"
    label: "Credit Card Generic decline"
    replace: '4000000000000002'
  - trigger: ":idcc"
    label: "Insufficient funds decline"
    replace: '4000000000009995'
  # Print the output of a shell command
  - trigger: ":shell"
    replace: "{{output}}"
    vars:
      - name: output
        type: shell
        params:
          cmd: "echo 'Hello from your shell'"
  - trigger: ":quote"
    replace: "{{output}}"
    vars:
      - name: output
        type: random
        params:
          choices:
            - "Every moment is a fresh beginning."
            - "Everything you can imagine is real."
            - "Whatever you do, do it well."
